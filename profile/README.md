## About

We use interdisciplinary and translational approaches to examine nervous system factors contributing to inter-individual differences in pain phenotypes. Our research focuses on pain's functional consequences—including cognitive and mobility impairments—in older adults, using psychophysics, neuroimaging, and epigenetics.
