## About

We use interdisciplinary and translational approaches to examine nervous system factors contributing to inter-individual differences in pain phenotypes. Our research focuses on pain's functional consequences—including cognitive and mobility impairments—in older adults, using psychophysics, neuroimaging, and epigenetics.

## Research Studies

| Study | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **[CREATE TMD](https://tmj.org/pitt-researchers-launch-17m-nih-funded-study-on-tmd/)** | UF site for the $17M NIH-funded Collaborative for REsearch to Advance TMD Evidence, identifying temporomandibular disorder subtypes through brain imaging, RNA sequencing, epigenomics, proteomics, and microbiome profiling |
| **GALLOP** | Gait, Activity and Locomotion Links to Osteoarthritic Pain—studying pain perception in horses and its impact on mobility to bridge equine and human pain research |
| **ReJOIN** | Restoring joint health and function to reduce pain in patients undergoing knee or TMJ surgery |
| **UPBEAT** | Examining the relationship between brain aging and mobility outcomes |

## Research Focus

- Age-related pain perception and modulation
- Neurobiological mechanisms of chronic pain in older adults
- Pain's impact on cognitive function and mobility
- Clinical phenotyping methodologies
- Translational animal-to-human pain models
